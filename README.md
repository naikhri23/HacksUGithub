Built for HackSU for the Connections track.

## Slide SU

Slide SU is an anonymous questioning platform designed to enhance student engagement during lectures. It allows students to submit and upvote questions on lecture slides, providing a judgment-free way to participate in class discussions.

## Features

* Upload & Share Slides: Professors can upload PowerPoint slides and generate a unique code for students to access.

* Anonymous Questioning: Students can submit questions anonymously on specific slides.

* Upvote System: Students can upvote questions they relate to, helping professors prioritize the most relevant ones.

* AI-Generated Questions: Students can choose from two difficulty levels of AI-generated questions to enhance their understanding.

* Real-Time Interaction: Ensures live engagement between students and professors.

## How We Built It

Slide SU was built using React.js and VSCode Live Share. While exploring backend solutions, we faced challenges due to the collaborative nature of VSCode Live Share. Ultimately, we leveraged Reactâ€™s capabilities to create a real-time experience without a traditional database.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
